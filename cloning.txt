git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2     
# This clones and creates a directory named libgit2, initializes a .git directory inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository, and checks out a working copy of the latest version. If you go into the new libgit2 directory that was just created, you'll see the project files in there, ready to be worked on or used.

# If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than libgit2, you can specify the new directory name as an additional argument:
git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 mylibgit
