# The rules for the patterns you can put in the .gitignore file are as follows:
#   Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.
#   Standard glob patterns work, and will be applied recursively throughout the entire working tree.
#   You can start patterns with a forward slash (/) to avoid recursivity.
#   You can end patterns with a forward slash (/) to specify a directory.
#   You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (!).
#   Glob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use.
#      (*) matches zero or more characters;
#      [abc] matches any character inside the brackets (in this case a, b, or c);
#      (?) matches a single character;
#      [0-9] matches any character between them (in this case 0 through 9).
#      You can also use two asterisks to match nested directories; a/**/z would match a/z, a/b/z, a/b/c/z, and so on.
#
# Examples:
# ignore all .a files
# *.a
#
# # but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
# !lib.a
#
# # only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO
# /TODO
#
# # ignore all files in any directory named build
# build/
#
# # ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
# doc/*.txt
#
# # ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory and any of its subdirectories
# doc/**/*.pdf
